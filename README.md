# 4k Clojure Demo Competition


Me and [Martin](http://martinsprogrammingblog.blogspot.co.uk) were discussing the feasibility of this and quickly ended up in a debate about the rules, which he won.
More or less, your demo has to be a 4k stripped Clojure jar, that can be run like this:

    java -cp clojure-1.4.0.jar:target/four.jar four

    $ ls -l target/four.jar
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 hraberg hraberg 2030 2012-08-22 12:00 target/four.jar

    $ unzip -l target/four.jar
    Archive:  target/four.jar
      Length      Date    Time    Name
    ---------  ---------- -----   ----
          100  2012-08-22 12:00   META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
         1670  2012-08-22 12:00   four.class
         1570  2012-08-22 12:00   four.clj
    ---------                     -------

### Rules

Fork and go. The bash script [`build`](https://github.com/hraberg/four/blob/master/build) will produce (and run) a jar that satisfies the limitations.
Dependencies and resources are allowed, but obviously need to fit the size limit. PACK200 is allowed, as is [ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/), which the `build` script uses. Pulling resources from the network or local drive is not. We're planning to support OpenGL, see below.


### Example

[`four.clj`](https://github.com/hraberg/four/blob/master/src/four.clj) is an experiment that sets up a few seqs / fns for rendering over a timeline in Graphics2D.
The animation itself is just a flickering of colors, but will obviously soon evolve into a magnificent real time [path tracer](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/).


### OpenGL

[`nehe-lesson-02.clj`](https://github.com/hraberg/four/blob/master/test/nehe_lesson_2.clj) is Nehe's classic ["Your First Polygon"](http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/your_first_polygon/13002/) lesson using [JOGL](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) and a minimal GL wrapper, [`minigl.clj`](https://github.com/hraberg/four/blob/master/test/minigl.clj) (optional - it counts towards the bytes!). The build doesn't properly take OpenGL into account yet, but this can be run using:

    lein run -m nehe-lesson-2


### Music

I've started working on a very rudimentary software synthesizer, [`vlead.clj`](https://github.com/hraberg/four/blob/master/test/vlead.clj) in pure Clojure using [javax.sound.sampled](http://www.jsresources.org/index.html) for output. This one isn't optimized for size as it needs to work first.
